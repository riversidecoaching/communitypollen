      <h2>The Meadow</h3><br>
      <p>Bees, butterflies and other pollinators eat nectar from the flowers. Flowers benefit from this, as this helps them reach each other for fecundation. So you can think of a meadow as a bee restaurant: a place for them to eat. But remember: flowers need insects too to spread pollen across to each other. Bees, one of the biggest pollinators of flowers, use both Nectar and Pollen. For bees, the nectar is one of the primary sources of energy. In fact, all honey is made out of nectar, whereas pollen is used primarily for protein and as food for larvae.</p>

      <h2>The Bee Bank</h3><br>
      <p>The majority of the other 25,000 or so bee species are solitary, nesting in the ground, in tunnels inside wood, or in dried hollow stems (some desert bees even burrow into sandstone!) Even though these bees are solitary (each female provisions a nest for her own offspring), they often nest in “communities” that can number into the thousands. If you see a number of miniature volcano-type mounds in your soil, you may have stumbled on a group of ground-dwelling bees, such as mining or sweat bees!</p>

      <h2>The Orchard</h3><br>
      <p>It contains several apple and plum trees. In early May, apple trees are covered in apple blossoms. In order for the blossoms to become apples, they must be cross-pollinated. This means that the pollen must travel from one flower to another before fertilisation can occur. Bees are responsible for this essential task!</p>
